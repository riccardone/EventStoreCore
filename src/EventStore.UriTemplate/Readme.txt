About this project UriTemplate  

This project is to run EventStore on .Net Core and allow backward compatibility of the existing HTTP module. It is a port from Microsoft .Net 4.8 to .Net Standard of the UriTemplate and UriTemplateMatch classes and related dependencies. 
The original framework code has been adjusted removing all the framework logging and unnecessary dependencies but keeping the same api and logic.

All the credits of the original code is on Microsoft and the great teams that have been working on System.ServiceModel
